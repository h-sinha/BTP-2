# BTP-2
The project is about the development of an intelligent Hydroinformatics integration platform to derive a user-friendly web interface system using machine learning algorithms and visualisation for improving online forecast capability and flood risk management. The developed platform is capable of providing multi-step-ahead regional flood inundation maps with the interface of Google Maps. The novelty of the developed model will help communities in making better-informed decisions about the occurrence of flood and alerts communities in advance.
